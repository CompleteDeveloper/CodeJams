# Developer Launchpad Code Jams

Each month Developer Launchpad meets to go through a coding challenge as a group and review our results.

This repository is a collection of our challenges as well as participant solutions. Each folder will contain the markdown(md) file of the challenge along with subfolders for languages that participants can submit their solutions.
