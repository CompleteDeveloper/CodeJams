# Developer Launchpad Coding Jam Contributions

There are two ways to contribute to the Coding Jam repository. You may add your solution to an existing challenge. 

## Solutions

### Naming Conventions

Name your file of folder with your name, name of challenge, and level. Ex: `beej-bowling-scores-level1.js`

### Placement

Make sure to place your file(s) in the folder associated with the language of your solution. If a language folder doesn't exist for that solution create one.

## New Challenges

New challenges should be written in markdown. Each challenge should include three levels with a step further for additional work if the level is completed. As we try to emphasize testing your code a section about unit tests should be included.

### Levels

**Level 1** is for beginners to coding. The challenges here should be completed by a new developer or student within an hour.

**Level 2** is for junior developers or those just finishing school. It should be challenging enough for them to spend an hour designing a solution and implementing it.

**Level 3** is the trickiest as it is designed for more experienced programmers. This can be a challenge for someone with 5+ years in the industry.
